# SRPN
A program to match the functionality of a saturated reverse Polish notation calculator. This was an investigative project during the Principles of Programming module at the University of Bath.

"Whilst performing some maintenance on a legacy system you find that it makes use of a program called SRPN. 
SRPN is not documented and no one seems to know who wrote it, so your boss tells you to rewrite it in Java. 
SRPN is a reverse Polish notation calculator with the extra feature that all arithmetic is saturated, i.e. when it reaches the maximum value that can be stored in a variable, it stays at the maximum rather than wrapping around."

1. The task was to write a program which matches the functionality of SRPN as closely as possible. This included not adding or enhancing existing features.

2. The legacy program and the example code needed to edit were provided.

This assignment was awarded 75% - a distinction.
